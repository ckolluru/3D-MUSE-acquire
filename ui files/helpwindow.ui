Ensure that the microtome is in the 3D mode by following the steps in the microtome user manual. The cut mode of the microtome should be set to single. Set the section thickness to 3 microns and the cutting speed to the first black line on the dial (corresponds to 0.5). The cutting angle of the knife should be 4 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Clamp the tissue block into the sample holder with the pointed edge oriented towards the knife. Tighten the vice clamp. If desired, the knife guard can be used to ensure that the knife does not touch the skin. After the block is clamped, the knife guard can be opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Retract the sample away from the knife edge. Next, carefully advance the sample forward towards the knife such that the sample is close to the knife edge but does not touch it. You should ensure that there is a visible gap by eye between the knife edge and the sample. The handwheel on the microtome is always turned clockwise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Clean the edge of the knife using a brush to ensure that it is free of debris. Use a styrofoam stick and knife cleaning fluid to wipe any additional debris on the knife. The stick should be held at an angle of 45 degrees and gently moved over the knife. Do not apply too much pressure as this may damage the knife. Always keep track of knife usage as knives are changed in the system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT: It is advised to either move the knife to a fresh edge or place a new knife every 2-3 samples (10,000 to 15,000 cuts).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Ensure that the fan is properly aligned towards the block. This is required to remove sections sticking to the block surface after a cut. A vibration isolation pad is used to reduce vibrations from the fan on to the imaging system. The fan speed is set to 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</string>

Switch on the power supply to the light source and the motorized XYZ stages. Connect the USB cables for the camera and Arduino to their designated slots on the acquisition computer. USB connections from the XYZ stages are always connected to the computer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt;&quot;&gt;CAUTION: When the Arduino is connected to the computer, the digital pins are reset (go from high to low), which will cause a cutting cycle to occur. It is thus important to pull the sample block away from the knife initially to ensure that the knife is not damaged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt;&quot;&gt;2. Open MicroManager and choose the pycromanager.cfg configuration file. This will launch the MicroManager window.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt;&quot;&gt;3. If not already done, run the 3D-MUSE-acquire software. It is available as a batch script on the desktop or can be run if the software repository is set up in Visual Studio Code. You are already running it if you are seeing this in the Help &amp;gt; Instructions tab.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt;&quot;&gt;4. Click the initialize Arduino button. This will establish the connection between the python acquisition software and the Arduino. When done, the initialize Arduino button will be greyed out since you need to do this only once per run of the software.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt;&quot;&gt;CAUTION: This operation will also reset the digital pins on the Arduino (go from high to low), which will cause a cutting cycle to occur. It is thus important to pull the sample block away from the knife initially to ensure that the knife is not damaged. If cutting was occurring previously, this will cause one section to be cut.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt;&quot;&gt;5. If the XYZ stages were rebooted, it is necessary to home the stages to their zero positions. Press the home stages button. This operation will take a while, but when done, the home stages button will be greyed out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</string>

When a resin block is placed on the microtome, the block may need to be sectioned first to expose the nerve surface. We refer to this process as trimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Enter the desired folder location for storing the image stack. A log file will be created in this location during the session with useful debug information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Enter the number of cuts desired in the corresponding text box. Each cut will be 3 µm thick, unless the sectioning thickness was changed on the microtome control panel. Thus, if 1 mm of the sample needs to be cut, enter 333 cuts. Ensure that the switch on light source checkbox is off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAUTION: Do not provide more cuts than what is physically possible. It is useful to measure the length of the block with a scale and ensure that the cutting does not extend into the yellow resin portion of the block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Ensure that the trim the block – do not collect images checkbox is checked. Other properties in the acquisition window are not relevant for trimming and will be disregarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</string>

          <string>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head/&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt;&quot;&gt;Steps for imaging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;1. We will set up tiles for imaging prior to running an imaging session. The tile set up is done primarily in Micromanager software. However, we set the exposure time text box in the acquisition software to a suitable value, around 200 ms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;2. Click the Live button in Micromanager to open a live view window, displaying the current image from the camera. An additional window labeled “Inspect-Preview” is also shown with the histogram of the current image. Click on the full scale button to ensure that the live view is mapping the image intensities correctly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;3. Open the Stage control window in Micromanager. Use the stage window to move around the sample, changing the move step sizes on the stage window if required. There are three step sizes available (&amp;gt;, &amp;gt;&amp;gt;, &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;). Each arrow can be configured to take a step of a certain distance. Do not change the X and Y distances for the field with three arrows (&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;) unless the objective lens has been changed. This is because these numbers are important when setting up tiles. When using tiles with 20% overlap, the distance in the &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; field should be 2800 µm in X and 2100 µm in Y for the 4x objective. For the 10x objective, it should be 1100 µm in X and 888 µm in Y.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;4. When panning around the sample to view the nerve, ensure that the switch on light source checkbox is selected (this is the only case when you need to check this box manually, an imaging session will automatically switch the light source on and off as required). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;5. The image can be window/leveled if the brightness is not optimal. The window level and gamma settings are available directly on the histogram in the Inspect Preview window. If the brightness is too high, the exposure can be reduced to 100 ms. In general, blocks are usually brighter in the center than at the edge, so it is not an issue if the first image is slightly dark, and the histogram is primarily in the lower half. Intensity normalization methods can be applied later if desired.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;6. To set up tiles, open the Multi D acquisition tab in MicroManager, and select Edit Position list. Open the stage control window as well if not already open. Pan around the sample and focus on the block as desired. If the sample is not visible, you may need to run another trimming session. Moving along the Z stage will help with focusing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;7. If nerve is completely visible (full cross-section), use the create grid option in the Edit Position list window. There is a box that says overlap, change it from um (default) to %. Set the overlap to 20%, ensure the pixel size is correct (0.9 µm if you are using the 4x objective, 0.37 µm if you are using the 10x objective). If they are incorrect, these values can be changed in Objective configuration and preset Objective-A (4x) and Objective-B (10x) in the main window of MicroManager. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;8. In the Create Grid window, set the individual corners as desired. The step distance with the &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in the stage window is now useful, since one step by &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; will move the stage by amount that is slightly less than a tile (80%). This will let you set up perfect tiles (one &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; step in X and one &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; step in Y and setting the appropriate top, left, bottom and right corners will result in the creation of a 2x2 grid). As described earlier, for the 4x objective, this distance &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; should be 2800 µm in X and 2100 µm in Y. For 10x objective, it should be 1100 µm in X and 888 µm in Y.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;IMPORTANT: When setting up tiles, make sure that the tiles will be sufficient for the full length of the nerve. For example, if the nerve is oriented such that it moves downward in the block, it may be useful to set up 2 tiles in the Y direction and 1 tile in X direction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;9. Select OK on the grid creator window, now you should see positions populate in the MDA window. Click the go to button after selecting each tile position and focus using the Z stage control as required. Click the Merge button and then the Merge with current Stage position. This will ensure that each tile is set up with the best focus position. Save the positions to a file with a suitable name in the same directory as the storage directory. If the first image acquisition is to be captured, save the file as PositionList_1.pos. If 3 acquisitions are already captured in the folder, save the file as PositionList_4.pos. This will ensure easy loading of positions later if required. This may be needed if the python acquisition software closes due to an error and the acquisition does not change to Finished in Micromanager. MicroManager and the acquisition software would need to be restarted in that case, and having the position list saved to a file is extremely useful to ensure the same tile setup between runs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;10. Ensure that the correct objective magnification is selected from the dropdown box in the acquisition software. Two objective options are currently provided, 4x and 10x. MicroManager should automatically recognize the correct pixel sizes to use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;11. Set number of cuts as desired. If stitching is needed, it will be done automatically and saved in a separate directory in the same storage folder. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;CAUTION: Do not provide more cuts than what is physically possible. It is useful to measure the length of the block with a scale and ensure that the cutting does not extend into the yellow resin portion of the block.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;12. If desired, an autofocus algorithm can be run at intermediate slices. Add an appropriate value to that line item. Usually autofocus every 5 images is sufficient. If the value is set to zero autofocus is not performed, if the value is 1 autofocus is done on all images.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;13. Images can be skipped between sections. Add an appropriate value in the corresponding text box. If 0, no images are skipped. In general, if every fifth slice needs to be imaged, the skip image option can be set to four.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;14. If desired a z-stack can be setup at each tile. This is suitable when working with an objective with a low depth of focus, e.g, 10x 0.45 NA. Individual slices in a z-stack are automatically stitched and merged into a single image. If Z start is set to -3, Z stop is set to 3, and Z step is set to 1, the software will collect images at z-3, z-2, z-1, z, z+1, z+2, and z+3 microns. The seven resultant images will be stitched to create a single image. This algorithm is currently being implemented, so please set these three values to zeros for now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;15. Uncheck switch on light source and trim the block – do not collect images options. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;16. Stop the live view in micromanager.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:11pt; font-weight:400;&quot;&gt;17. Click start acquisition button. A progress bar and status message box will be updated during each cutting and imaging event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</string>
